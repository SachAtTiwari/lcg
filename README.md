# lcg

####
This lib uses the LCG(Linear congruential generator) algorithm to generate random number of given range.

####
Problem Statement :Write a custom random number generation algo which should be 73% biased to the higher number.
Like if I want a random number between 1 to 10 100times then it should give number more than 5
73times and less than 5 27times.

####
In test function we use random list to store the random numbers in which we store higher biased number first by using randIntRange function in b/w 5 to 10(assumed value, can be changed) 

In second part we store lower biased number from (0  to 5) in random number list
